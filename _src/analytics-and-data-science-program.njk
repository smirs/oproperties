              On our 1-hour introduction call with you, we will simply understand your business, your future goals, needs, priorities, KPIs, and requirements. Don't worry! You won't be paying anything for the initial assessment. A 'Statement of Work' will be drafted containing the points mentioned above and what's the best way to work with you and your business. In the end, a Contract will be signed if our initial assessment meets your needs and business criteria.
