## 1. **Conduct Regular Inspections to Catch Problems Early**

Regular property inspections are one of the most effective ways to prevent costly repairs and ensure that your rental property remains in good shape. As a first-time landlord, it’s tempting to assume that everything is fine once your tenants have moved in. However, failing to perform regular inspections can lead to minor issues snowballing into major problems that could have been easily prevented.

### Why Inspections Matter

* **Catch Small Problems Early:** During inspections, you can identify things like leaky faucets, small cracks in walls, or damaged roofing before they become expensive repairs.
* **Maintain Tenant Safety:** Ensuring that electrical wiring, plumbing, and structural elements are intact is critical to preventing safety hazards. This protects both your tenants and your property.
* **Set Expectations:** Regular inspections help establish trust between you and your tenants. They’ll know that you care about the condition of the property and are committed to providing a safe, comfortable living space.

### How to Conduct Inspections

* **Frequency:** Conduct a full inspection every 6-12 months, depending on the property and lease agreement. Additionally, inspect after any tenant moves out and before new tenants move in.
* **Documentation:** Create a checklist for inspections to ensure that you’re thoroughly examining key areas, including plumbing, HVAC systems, appliances, and structural elements like the foundation and roof. Take detailed notes and photographs for future reference.
* **Give Notice:** In St. Louis, as in many other cities, you must give tenants proper notice before entering the property for an inspection. Typically, 24-48 hours’ notice is required, unless specified otherwise in the lease agreement.

## 2. **Develop a Preventive Maintenance Schedule**

Preventive maintenance is one of the most cost-effective ways to manage a rental property. Instead of waiting for things to break down, schedule regular maintenance tasks to extend the lifespan of appliances, plumbing, and other systems in the home. A proactive approach ensures that minor issues are fixed before they become major problems.

### Key Areas for Preventive Maintenance

* **HVAC System:** In St. Louis, where summers can be hot and humid and winters can be cold, ensuring that your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are in good working order is vital. Change filters regularly, clean ducts, and have the system inspected annually.
* **Plumbing:** Schedule regular inspections of plumbing systems to catch leaks, clogged drains, and potential water damage. Regular maintenance can prevent costly repairs like pipe bursts or water damage, which are often a result of ignored small leaks.
* **Roofing and Gutters:** St. Louis experiences all four seasons, which means your property’s roof and gutters will experience wear and tear. Regular gutter cleaning and roof inspections help prevent water damage from clogged gutters or a leaking roof.
* **Appliances:** From refrigerators to dishwashers, ensure your appliances are regularly serviced to prevent breakdowns. If any appliances are aging, consider replacing them before they break down entirely.

### How to Create a Preventive Maintenance Schedule

* **Create a Checklist:** Make a list of the areas that need to be regularly maintained and include tasks such as filter changes, cleaning, inspections, and seasonal tasks. For example, HVAC system servicing should be done before the summer and winter seasons.
* **Set Reminders:** Use calendar reminders or property management software to stay on track with regular maintenance tasks. This will help you stay organized and ensure nothing is missed.
* **Professional Help:** For some tasks, like HVAC inspections or roofing, it’s wise to hire professionals. Make sure to schedule these services in advance, especially during peak seasons when contractors are busiest.

## 3. **Know When to Handle Repairs Yourself and When to Hire a Professional**

As a first-time landlord, you may be tempted to handle every repair yourself to save money. However, DIY maintenance can often lead to mistakes, which can cause more damage or safety issues. Understanding when to handle repairs and when to hire a professional is crucial.

### DIY vs. Hiring a Professional

* **DIY Repairs:** Simple tasks, such as changing light bulbs, replacing air filters, or cleaning appliances, are usually safe to handle yourself. These are low-cost tasks that don’t require special expertise.
* **Hiring a Professional:** When it comes to more complex repairs—like plumbing issues, electrical problems, or major HVAC work—it’s best to hire licensed professionals. They have the tools, expertise, and knowledge to resolve issues safely and efficiently. Additionally, professionals are often familiar with local codes, which helps ensure that the repairs are up to code and legal.

### How to Decide

* **Assess the Risk:** If the repair poses a risk to tenant safety (e.g., electrical issues or gas leaks), always hire a professional.
* **Know Your Limits:** If you don’t have the necessary skills or knowledge, it’s best to avoid DIY repairs. Hiring someone with experience can save you time and money in the long run.
* **Build Relationships with Contractors:** As a first-time landlord, it’s a good idea to build relationships with trusted local contractors who can provide reliable services at fair prices. Having a go-to plumber, electrician, or HVAC technician can make handling repairs much easier.

## 4. **Stay on Top of Tenant Requests for Repairs**

One of the most common sources of conflict between landlords and tenants is the handling of repair requests. Promptly addressing tenant concerns about maintenance is essential for maintaining a positive relationship, protecting your investment, and complying with local laws.

### The Importance of Timely Repairs

* **Tenant Satisfaction:** Responding quickly to maintenance requests shows tenants that you care about their well-being and are dedicated to keeping the property in good condition. This can lead to long-term, happy tenants who are more likely to renew their lease.
* **Legal Compliance:** In Missouri, as in many other states, landlords are legally required to provide habitable living conditions. Ignoring tenant repair requests can lead to legal consequences, such as rent withholding or tenants taking legal action.
* **Prevent Further Damage:** Delaying repairs can allow problems to worsen, resulting in more extensive—and expensive—repairs down the line.

### How to Manage Tenant Repair Requests

* **Create a Request System:** Set up an easy and efficient system for tenants to submit maintenance requests, whether through an online portal, email, or phone. Make sure tenants know how to report issues and provide clear instructions on what to do in case of emergencies.
* **Acknowledge Requests Promptly:** When a tenant submits a repair request, acknowledge receipt within 24 hours. This helps build trust and shows that you take their concerns seriously.
* **Prioritize Urgent Repairs:** Some repairs—like plumbing leaks or electrical issues—should be prioritized over others. Always handle emergency situations immediately to prevent further damage and ensure tenant safety.

## 5. **Budget for Maintenance and Repairs**

One of the most important things you can do as a first-time landlord is to set aside a budget specifically for maintenance and repairs. Unexpected repair costs are inevitable, and without a proper budget, they can quickly eat into your profits.

### Why a Maintenance Budget Is Essential

* **Unexpected Expenses:** No matter how proactive you are with maintenance, things will inevitably break or need attention. Having a maintenance budget ensures that you’re financially prepared for these unexpected costs.
* **Avoid Financial Stress:** If you rely solely on rental income to cover repairs, you may find yourself scrambling for funds when a major repair is needed. A dedicated maintenance fund provides financial peace of mind and helps prevent cash flow issues.
* **Long-Term Property Care:** Over time, you’ll need to replace appliances, repaint walls, or make larger improvements to keep the property competitive in the rental market. Having a maintenance budget helps you plan for these expenses and maintain the property’s value.

### How to Create a Maintenance Budget

* **Set a Percentage of Rent:** A common rule of thumb is to set aside 1-2% of the property’s value per year for maintenance. For example, if your property is valued at $150,000, aim to budget $1,500–$3,000 annually for repairs and maintenance.
* **Account for Routine and Emergency Repairs:** Break your budget into categories, such as routine maintenance (HVAC inspections, gutter cleaning) and emergency repairs (plumbing, electrical issues). Keep an emergency fund for unexpected expenses.
* **Track Your Expenses:** Keep detailed records of all maintenance and repair costs to help you stay within your budget and plan for future expenses.
