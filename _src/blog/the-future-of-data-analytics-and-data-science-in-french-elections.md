# The Statistics of Elections in France and the Impact of Data Analytics and Data Science

## Introduction

Elections are a crucial aspect of democracy, reflecting the will of the people and shaping the political landscape. In France, elections have a rich history, marked by significant events and changes over time. The evolution of data analytics and data science has brought a transformative impact on how elections are conducted, analyzed, and understood. This article explores the statistics of French elections and how data analytics and data science are revolutionizing the electoral process.

## A Historical Overview of French Elections

### Early Elections

French elections date back to the French Revolution in 1789, which established the National Assembly. The subsequent years saw the development of various electoral systems, including the establishment of universal male suffrage in 1848.

### The Fifth Republic

The Fifth Republic, established in 1958, brought significant changes to the French electoral system. It introduced the semi-presidential system, with both a President and a Prime Minister. Presidential elections occur every five years, while legislative elections determine the composition of the National Assembly. [BBC - Fifth Republic](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45042323)

## Key Statistics of French Elections

### Voter Turnout

Voter turnout is a critical metric in elections, reflecting the engagement and participation of the electorate. In France, voter turnout has varied significantly over the years.

- **Presidential Elections**: Turnout in presidential elections has generally been high. For instance, in the 2017 election, the first-round turnout was 77.8%, while the second round saw a turnout of 74.6%. [The Guardian - French Presidential Turnout](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/23/french-presidential-election-turnout)
- **Legislative Elections**: Legislative elections typically see lower turnout compared to presidential elections. In the 2017 legislative elections, the turnout was 48.7% in the first round and 42.6% in the second round.
