# Competing with Myself: Lessons from *Prince of Persia* for Job Seekers and Professionals

When I was a kid, *Prince of Persia* was *the* game. It was the early 90s, and in that era, personal computers were still a novelty. My father worked in a bank in the computing department, which was one of the first places in the country to have access to these new machines. I used to tag along with him, waiting eagerly for the moment when everyone had gone home. That’s when I could finally start playing *Prince of Persia*—my go-to game.

I still remember the thrill of those moments. The office would be quiet, save for the hum of the computers. I had to play with the sound off, of course—no one wanted to draw attention to a kid playing video games after hours. For years, that’s how I played, silently guiding the Prince through his perilous journey, all while absorbing the lessons hidden in the game’s challenges. It wasn’t until much later, when I had the luxury of a PC at home, that I played with the sound on and fully immersed myself in the experience. But by then, the game had already taught me something profound about life, especially as I faced the challenges of the job market as a professional.

## The Mirror Duel: A Scene That Stuck with Me

One scene in *Prince of Persia* has stayed with me over the years, leaving a lasting impact on how I view challenges in life and work. The Prince encounters a mirror version of himself—a doppelgänger that appears out of nowhere, blocking his path. Unlike other enemies, this mirror fighter isn’t affected by the Prince’s attacks. No matter how hard you try, he doesn’t get hurt, and nothing seems to bother him. He’s invincible and will inevitably defeat the Prince if the fight continues. The frustration builds as you realize that there’s no way to win through conventional means.

But the solution to this puzzle is both simple and profound: you must pull off your sword and put it back in its place. When the Prince does this, his mirror image does the same, and something extraordinary happens—the two become unified. The mirror version merges with the Prince, symbolizing a deeper truth that resonates far beyond the game. As I grew older, particularly in my professional life, I came to truly understand the power of this message.

## Applying the Lesson to the Job Market

The mirror duel in *Prince of Persia* taught me something important about the nature of competition, especially in the context of job seeking and career development. As professionals, it’s easy to get caught up in the idea that our careers are a series of battles to be fought and won—whether it’s landing that perfect job, outperforming colleagues, or climbing the corporate ladder. The pressure to succeed can be overwhelming, leading to stress, self-doubt, and burnout.

In many ways, I was like the Prince facing his mirror image, struggling to outdo myself, setting higher and higher expectations, and often being my harshest critic. This internal battle could be exhausting, especially during times of job searching, where every rejection feels like a personal failure. But the lesson from the game was clear: sometimes, the way forward isn’t to fight harder, but to step back and understand that the real challenge lies within.

### The Early Days: Navigating Career Challenges

Playing *Prince of Persia* in that quiet bank office with the sound off gave me time to reflect. The silence allowed me to focus on the game’s subtleties, and the mirror duel became a recurring metaphor in my mind. Later in life, I began to see parallels between the game and my professional journey. During my career, there were times when I felt like I was constantly competing—not just with others, but with myself. The pressure to be the best, to achieve more, and to prove my worth was relentless.

But over time, I realized that this relentless pursuit of success was more about proving something to myself than to anyone else. The true challenge, I discovered, wasn’t in outperforming others but in becoming a better version of myself. Just as the Prince couldn’t defeat his mirror image by fighting, I couldn’t achieve true professional success by constantly battling myself. Instead, I needed to learn when to put the sword down—to let go of the need for constant validation and to focus on personal growth.

### The Power of Letting Go in Your Career

The act of sheathing the sword in *Prince of Persia* is a powerful symbol of letting go, especially relevant for job seekers and professionals. In our careers, we often cling to our ambitions, desires, and ego, believing that we must constantly fight to achieve our goals. Whether it’s securing that dream job, earning a promotion, or meeting every deadline, the pressure to succeed can be intense.

But the game taught me that letting go doesn’t mean giving up. Instead, it means releasing the need to control everything, to always be the best, and to measure success by external standards. In my career, this lesson has been invaluable. There were times when I had to accept that certain opportunities weren’t right for me, that setbacks were part of the journey, and that true success comes from aligning my career with my values and passions.

Letting go has been a recurring theme in my professional life. Whether it was learning to accept a job rejection, changing career paths, or simply recognizing that I didn’t have to prove anything to anyone, the lesson from the mirror duel has guided me. By putting the sword down, I’ve been able to find peace in the process rather than the outcome. It’s allowed me to appreciate the journey of professional growth and to focus on what truly matters to me.

### Embracing Self-Reflection and Growth in the Job Market

The mirror duel also emphasized the importance of self-reflection. Just as the Prince had to understand his mirror image to overcome the challenge, I’ve learned that understanding myself is key to personal and professional growth. This involves being honest about my motivations, fears, and desires. Self-reflection has become a tool for setting meaningful career goals and for measuring progress, not against others, but against who I was yesterday.

Over the years, I’ve found that competing with myself leads to a deeper sense of fulfillment in my career. It’s not about achieving perfection, but about continuous improvement. Whether it’s mastering a new skill, overcoming a professional challenge, or simply becoming more mindful of my career choices, the focus is always on growth. And when I fall short, I’ve learned to be kind to myself, recognizing that setbacks are a natural part of the journey.

### The First Time with Sound: A New Perspective on Professional Growth

Years later, when I finally had my own PC and could play *Prince of Persia* with the sound on, it was like experiencing the game for the first time all over again. The music, the sound effects—it all added a new dimension to the gameplay. But by then, the game had already taught me its most important lesson: the real challenge is within.

Playing with the sound on was a reminder that while external factors can enhance our experiences, the core lessons often come from within. Just as the sound enriched the game, my experiences and reflections over the years have deepened my understanding of self-competition in the professional world. It’s not about what others think or how I compare to them; it’s about how I measure up to my own standards and aspirations.

## Conclusion: The True Measure of Professional Success

In reflecting on my journey with *Prince of Persia*, I’ve come to realize that the true measure of success isn’t how I compare to others, but how I compare to myself. The mirror duel taught me that the greatest challenge is not external, but internal, and that the path to overcoming it lies in understanding, acceptance, and growth.

When we compete with ourselves in our careers, we shift our focus from external validation to internal fulfillment. We learn to appreciate our unique journey and to find joy in the process of becoming who we are meant to be, both personally and professionally. So, the next time you find yourself caught in the trap of comparison or overwhelmed by the challenges of the job market, remember the lesson of the Prince: sometimes, the only way to win is to put down the sword and embrace who you are.

In your career and in life, you are your greatest competitor, and that is where your true power lies.
