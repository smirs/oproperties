As 2023 comes to an end, O'Fallon Labs journey continues.
It might not be huge but the impacts makes me happy and I'd like to share that with you today! I thought you would like to see it.

Here is a quick summary of O'Labs in 2023:

* Over 300 1-on-1 meetings booked mainly for resume review and 1on1 mentoring
* Organic growth is well on track (reached 200 clicks per month via Google Search)
* Our offered services attracted another 5,000 new visitors from all around the globe

Thank you for being with me in this journey this year!
