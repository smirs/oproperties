   A clean property makes a great first impression. Consider hiring a professional cleaning service to deep clean the property, including carpets, windows, and appliances.

   Make sure your property meets all local safety and housing codes. This includes installing smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and ensuring all electrical and plumbing systems are up to code.

### **Setting the Right Rental Price**

Pricing your rental property correctly is crucial for attracting tenants and maximizing your income. Here’s how to set the right rental price:

1. **Research Comparable Properties**\
   Look at similar properties in O’Fallon to get an idea of the going rental rates. Consider factors like location, size, and amenities when comparing properties.
2. **Consider Market Conditions**\
   Take into account the current market conditions, such as demand and vacancy rates. In a competitive market, you may be able to charge a higher rent, while in a slower market, you may need to lower your price to attract tenants.
3. **Factor in Expenses**\
   Make sure your rental price covers all your expenses, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. You should also aim to generate a profit.
4. **Be Flexible**\
   While it’s important to set a competitive rental price, be open to negotiation. Offering a slightly lower rent or including utilities can make your property more attractive to potential tenants.

   Use online platforms like Zillow, Craigslist, and social media to advertise your property. Include high-quality photos, a detailed description, and information about the rental price and lease terms.

   Hosting open houses allows potential tenants to view the property and ask questions. Be prepared to answer questions about the property, the neighborhood, and the application process.
3. **Screen Tenants Thoroughly**\
   A reliable tenant is key to a successful rental property. Conduct background checks, verify income, and check references to ensure you’re renting to responsible individuals.
4. **Review Applications Carefully**\
   Review all rental applications carefully and consider factors like credit score, rental history, and employment stability. Choose the tenant who best meets your criteria.

2. **Collect Rent on Time**\
   Set up a system for collecting rent, whether it’s through online payments, checks, or cash. Be consistent with due dates and late fees to encourage timely payments.
3. **Handle Maintenance Requests**\
   Address maintenance requests promptly to keep your tenants happy and your property in good condition. Consider hiring a property management company if you don’t have the time or expertise to handle repairs yourself.
4. **Conduct Regular Inspections**\
   Schedule regular inspections to ensure the property is being well-maintained. Give tenants proper notice before conducting an inspection.

3. **Stay Informed**\
   Keep up with local housing laws and regulations to ensure your rental practices comply with legal requirements.
4. **Plan for Vacancies**\
   Vacancies are inevitable, so plan ahead. Use vacancy periods to perform deep cleaning, repairs, and upgrades that are harder to do with tenants in place.
