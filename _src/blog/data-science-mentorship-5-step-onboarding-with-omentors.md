## Step 1: Sign up as a Mentee and Login!

The first step towards accessing our pool of experienced data science mentors is to sign up as a mentee on [OMENTORS.com](https://OMENTORS.com). Simply create an account using your email address and set up a password. Once registered, log in to your account to gain access to our platform's features and resources.

## Step 2: Add Your External Link

To facilitate effective mentorship, it's crucial for mentors to understand your background and professional experience. Add your external link, preferably your LinkedIn profile, during the onboarding process. This link will be accessible only to your assigned mentors, allowing them to gain insights into your educational background, work history, and skillset.

## Step 3: Fill Information in “My Background” Section

In the "My Background" section of your O'Mentors profile, provide detailed information about your educational background, previous work experience, and any relevant projects or achievements. This information serves as a valuable reference for your mentors, enabling them to tailor their guidance and support to your specific needs and aspirations. Rest assured that this information remains confidential and is visible only to your mentors.

## Step 4: Fill Information in “My Goals” Section

What are your career aspirations in the field of data science? Use the "My Goals" section to articulate your short-term and long-term goals, highlighting areas where you seek guidance and mentorship. Whether you're looking to enhance your technical skills, explore career opportunities, or navigate challenges in your current role, sharing your goals enables mentors to align their mentorship approach with your objectives. Remember, this information is accessible only to your mentors, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.

## Step 5: Apply to At Least One Mentor!

With your profile set up and goals defined, it's time to take the next step: applying to at least one mentor. Browse through our roster of data science mentors on [OMENTORS.com](https://OMENTORS.com) and select a mentor whose expertise and experience align with your goals and interests. Submit your application, detailing why you believe the selected mentor is the right fit for you.
